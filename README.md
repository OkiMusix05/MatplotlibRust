# MatplotlibRust
Matplotlib rust is a project template that you can copy (I use it with RustRover) that is already set up
for integration with python and matplotlib.\
This template is based on [inline-python](https://github.com/fusion-engineering/inline-python), so for
documentation on how to use this library head there. The only thing this template adds is pre-setting the
project to use Rust's _nightly_ build, so you can use the crate, and importing matplotlib and numpy at the start.\
When copying this file, you can **delete** this .md file.
